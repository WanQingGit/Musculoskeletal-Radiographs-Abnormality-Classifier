# Musculoskeletal Radiographs Abnormality Classifier

I was not able to reproduce the results promised in the paper in either pytorch or tensorflow. I wrote the authors several months ago and did not hear back. 

Unforunately, it looks like the authors have also since deleted a link to the previously released data without explanation. Several researchers have reached out to me for the data so I have re-uploaded it [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1XAsP0vLo4O07lgLBznMihawLl1h-Prny). Hopefully another will be able to reproduce the results.

## Experiments

| Network                | Accuracy (encounter) | Precision (encounter) | Recall (encounter) | F1 (encounter) | Kappa (encounter) |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------ | -------------- | ----------------- |
| DenseNet169 (baseline) | .83 (.84)            | .82 (.82)             | .87 (.90)          | .84 (.86)      | .65 (.65)         |
| MobileNet              | .81 (.83)            | .80 (.82)             | .85 (.89)          | .82 (.85)      |  .62 (.62)        |
| NASNetMobile           | .82 (.83)            | .78 (.80)             | .89 (.92)          | .83 (.86)      | .63 (.63)         |

Also, ResNet50 in pytorch which achieved equivalent results.
